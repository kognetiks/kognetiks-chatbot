# Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress

### Turn chatbot conversations into insight, not just answers.

Conversational AI is easy. Understanding its impact is not — until now.

The **Kognetiks Chatbot** helps WordPress site owners go beyond simply adding AI chat by turning real conversations into **clear, actionable insight**.

Instead of wondering whether your chatbot is helping, you’ll *see* what visitors are asking, *understand* why they’re asking it, and *prove* the value AI is delivering — automatically.

## Why Kognetiks Chatbot Exists

Adding AI chat is easy.

Understanding whether it’s *helping* is not.

Kognetiks is built for WordPress site owners who want visibility, accountability, and measurable value from conversational AI — not a black box.

## Conversation Digest

Automatically receive summarized insights from real chatbot conversations:
- Common questions and themes
- Emerging visitor intent
- Signals of confusion, friction, or opportunity
- High-level sentiment and engagement indicators

No dashboards to babysit.  
No transcripts to read.  
Just insight delivered to you.

## Proof-of-Value Reporting

AI is only useful if it creates value you can see.

Kognetiks generates proof-of-value summaries that help you:
- Understand usage and engagement trends
- Identify where AI is reducing repetitive work
- See where responses are strong — and where to improve
- Make informed decisions about prompts, content, and assistants

2. Conversations are logged securely
