# 📊 Analytics Package Overview

The **Analytics** tab in the Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress plugin provides a powerful dashboard to help you track, measure, and optimize chatbot performance on your site.

The analytics package summarizes data for sentiment analysis, engagement analysis, message and session statistics, and token usage.  You can quickly evaluate period-over-period changes in total conversations, unique visitors, average sentiment scores, and positive conversations.  To give you further insights, you can filter for visitors only, chatbot responses only, or both together.

**Note**: Conversation logging must be enabled for message scoring.  Go to the Reporting tab, then scoll down to the Reporting Settings section to enable logging.

## 🔍 Understanding Filter Prompts and Responses

The ability to filter and analyze visitor/user sentiment separately from chatbot sentiment is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Deeper Understanding of User Experience**
   - By separating visitor/user sentiment from chatbot sentiment, you can identify if negative sentiment is coming from frustrated users or if it's the chatbot's responses that are causing issues
   - This helps pinpoint exactly where in the conversation flow problems might be occurring

2. **Better Chatbot Optimization**
   - If visitor sentiment is consistently negative while chatbot sentiment is positive, it might indicate that the chatbot's responses, while technically correct, aren't effectively addressing user needs
   - Conversely, if chatbot sentiment is negative but visitor sentiment is positive, it could suggest the chatbot is being too formal or technical when users want more casual interaction

3. **Targeted Improvements**
   - You can make more informed decisions about what to improve:
     - If visitor sentiment is low, you might need to improve the chatbot's understanding of user intent
     - If chatbot sentiment is low, you might need to adjust the tone or style of responses
   - This separation allows for more precise tuning of the chatbot's personality and response patterns

4. **Quality Control**
   - It helps identify if the chatbot is maintaining appropriate emotional intelligence
   - You can ensure the chatbot's responses align with your desired brand voice and customer service standards
   - It provides a way to validate that the chatbot's sentiment analysis is working correctly

5. **Business Impact**
   - Understanding the sentiment dynamics helps improve customer satisfaction
   - It can lead to better conversion rates as you optimize the chatbot's interaction style
   - It helps maintain a positive brand image by ensuring the chatbot's tone matches your company's values
