## 📈 Insights Dashboard

The **Insights** tab provides a powerful dashboard to help you track, measure, and optimize chatbot performance on your site in real-time.

The insights dashboard summarizes data for sentiment analysis, engagement analysis, message and session statistics, and token usage. You can quickly evaluate period-over-period changes in total conversations, unique visitors, average sentiment scores, and positive conversations. To give you further insights, you can filter for visitors only, chatbot responses only, or both together.

### 📅 Period & Filter Controls

At the top of the Insights tab, you'll find controls that allow you to:

- **Period Selector** – Choose the comparison windows like `Today vs Yesterday`, `This Week vs Last Week`, etc.
- **Type Filter** – Filter results by conversation type, e.g., `All`, `Visitor`, `Chatbot`).

---

### 🔍 Understanding Filter Prompts and Responses

The ability to filter and analyze visitor/user sentiment separately from chatbot sentiment is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Deeper Understanding of User Experience**
   - By separating visitor/user sentiment from chatbot sentiment, you can identify if negative sentiment is coming from frustrated users or if it's the chatbot's responses that are causing issues
   - This helps pinpoint exactly where in the conversation flow problems might be occurring

2. **Better Chatbot Optimization**
   - If visitor sentiment is consistently negative while chatbot sentiment is positive, it might indicate that the chatbot's responses, while technically correct, aren't effectively addressing user needs
   - Conversely, if chatbot sentiment is negative but visitor sentiment is positive, it could suggest the chatbot is being too formal or technical when users want more casual interaction

3. **Targeted Improvements**
   - You can make more informed decisions about what to improve:
     - If visitor sentiment is low, you might need to improve the chatbot's understanding of user intent
     - If chatbot sentiment is low, you might need to adjust the tone or style of responses
   - This separation allows for more precise tuning of the chatbot's personality and response patterns

4. **Quality Control**
   - It helps identify if the chatbot is maintaining appropriate emotional intelligence
   - You can ensure the chatbot's responses align with your desired brand voice and customer service standards
   - It provides a way to validate that the chatbot's sentiment analysis is working correctly

5. **Business Impact**
   - Understanding the sentiment dynamics helps improve customer satisfaction
   - It can lead to better conversion rates as you optimize the chatbot's interaction style
   - It helps maintain a positive brand image by ensuring the chatbot's tone matches your company's values
