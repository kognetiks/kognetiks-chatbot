# **Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress** Plugin Documentation

**Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress** is a plugin that allows you to effortlessly integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT API into your website, providing a powerful, AI-driven chatbot for enhanced user experience and personalized support.

They are designed to answer questions, provide suggestions, and engage in conversations with users.

It can also be used to automate customer service, reduce response times, and improve customer satisfaction. Moreover, these platforms can be used in various fields such as healthcare, education, finance, and many more.
