# Kognetiks Chatbot: Free → Trial → Premium Upgrade Flow

This document explains how the Kognetiks Chatbot upgrade process works, from the free version to a 7-day Premium trial, and finally to a paid Premium subscription.

The goal of this process is to let you fully experience all Premium features before deciding whether to upgrade.

---

## Overview of the Upgrade Journey

The Kognetiks Chatbot follows a three-step upgrade path:

1. **Free Version** – Installed from WordPress.org
2. **Premium Trial (7 Days)** – Full Premium features, no credit card required
3. **Premium Subscription** – Continued access after the trial ends

Each step is intentional and includes confirmation so you always know what’s happening.

---

## Step 1: Using the Free Version

When you install **Kognetiks Chatbot (Free)** from the WordPress plugin directory:

- The plugin is fully functional with core chatbot features
- Advanced Premium features are visible but locked
- You may see “Start Free Trial” or “Unlock Premium Features” buttons in:
  - Plugin settings
  - Reporting or Insights screens
  - Admin notices

At this stage, **no account is required**, and **no data is sent to Freemius** until you choose to start a trial.

---

## Step 2: Starting the Free 7-Day Trial

When you click **Start Free Trial**, you are taken to the Kognetiks Chatbot pricing page.

### What You’ll See

- A clear banner indicating:
  > *Start your 7-day free trial*
- Confirmation that:
  - No credit card is required
  - All Premium features are included

## Step 3: Approving the Trial

When you click **Start My Free 7 Days**, a confirmation modal appears.

This step is required for WordPress.org compliance.

### What This Means

By clicking **Approve & Start Trial**, you are:

- Opting in to non-sensitive usage and site data sharing
- Allowing Freemius to validate your trial
- Creating a Freemius account (if one does not already exist)

**This approval is the opt-in step.**

## Step 4: Email Confirmation (Important)

After approval, you’ll see a notice in WordPress asking you to confirm your email address.

You will receive an email titled something like:

> **Activate Kognetiks Chatbot Trial**

Inside the email is a link:

> **Activate Trial on your site**

You must click this link to continue.

### Start Trial Notice

## Step 5: Trial Activated — Next Steps

Once the email confirmation link is clicked:

- Your trial officially starts
- You are redirected back to your WordPress admin
- A notice appears confirming:
  > *Your trial has been successfully started*

You will now see instructions to:

1. Download the **Premium version**
2. Upload and activate it in WordPress

## Step 6: Installing the Premium Plugin

During the trial, **Premium features are unlocked only when the Premium plugin is installed**.

### How This Works

- The Free plugin remains installed but is deactivated
- The Premium plugin is uploaded and activated
- No data or settings are lost
- The site immediately gains access to all Premium features

Start by clicking the "Download the latest Premium version" link.  Once downloaded, click "Choose File", Upload, then click "Install Now"

### Add Plugins

### Confirmation the Premium Plugin was installed and activated.

You’ll see a confirmation message like:

> *Premium plugin version was successfully activated.*

---

## Step 7: Using Premium During the Trial

While the trial is active:

- All Premium features are fully unlocked
- There are no feature limitations
- No payment method is required
- You can cancel at any time before the trial ends

You’ll also receive a confirmation email:

> **Your free 7-day trial has started**

This email includes:
- Trial duration
- Setup confirmation
- Account access details

## Step 8: Trial Expiration and Upgrade to Premium

Before the 7-day trial ends, you can choose to upgrade to a paid plan.

### If You Upgrade

- You select a Premium plan (monthly or annual)
- Payment is handled securely by Freemius
- No plugin reinstallation is required
- Your Premium access continues uninterrupted

### If You Do Not Upgrade

- Premium features are automatically locked when the trial ends
- The Premium plugin remains installed but gated
- You can downgrade to the Free version at any time

## Key Notes & Common Questions

### Do I need a credit card to start the trial?

No. The 7-day trial does not require a credit card.

### Why do I need to confirm my email?

Email confirmation prevents abuse and ensures the trial is tied to a real user and site.

### Why do I need to install a separate Premium plugin?

This ensures:

- WordPress.org compliance
- Clean separation between Free and Premium code
- Safe feature gating during trials and upgrades

### Can I test Premium safely?

Yes. The trial gives full access with no obligation to upgrade.

The Kognetiks Chatbot upgrade flow is designed to be:

- Transparent
- Reversible

**Free → Trial → Premium** is a deliberate, user-friendly progression that ensures you always stay in control.
