## Example Shortcodes

Here are some example shortcodes you can use to customize the chatbot's image generation functionality within your WordPress site:

- `[chatbot style="floating" model="dall-e-2"]`: Style is floating, specific model.

- `[chatbot style="embedded" model="dall-e-3"]`: Style is embedded, default image model.

## Tips

- **Quality vs. Speed**: Higher quality images (e.g., `HD`) may take longer to generate. Adjust the quality setting based on your need for speed versus visual fidelity.

- **Format Compatibility**: Ensure the selected image format is compatible with your website and other platforms where the images will be used.

- **Style Consistency**: Choose an image style that aligns with your brand or the specific theme of your content for a consistent user experience.

By configuring these settings, you ensure that your Kognetiks Chatbot can effectively generate images that meet your aesthetic and functional requirements, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal.
