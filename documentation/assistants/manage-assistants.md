## Managing Assistants

Effortlessly manage you chatbot Assistants all in one place using an intuitive interface.

You will no longer need to remember all the Assistant options, as they are all available on the GTP Assistants tab for you to view and edit.

Tailor each Assistant to meet the unique needs of your audience, ensuring an engaging and personalized experience for all.

If you have developed an Assistant in the OpenAI Playground, you will need the id of the assistant - it usually starts with ```asst_```.

More information can be found here https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=assistant.

When you're ready to use an Assistant, simply add a shortcode such as ```[chatbot-1]```, ```[chatbot-2]```, etc. to your page.

TIP: For best results ensure that the shortcode appears only once on the page.

TIP: When using the ```embedded``` style, it's best to put the shortcode in a page or post, not in the footer.

## Remote Widget Access

The **Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress** now includes the advanced feature to allow access to your assistants from remote servers.  Coupled with security measures to control and monitor remote access to your chatbots, you must enable the **Remote Widget Access** feature.  This will allow specific remote servers to interact with your chatbot(s) via an endpoint. To ensure that only authorized servers and chatbots can access your resources, the system uses a whitelisting mechanism that pairs domains with specific chatbot shortcodes, for example ```kognetiks.com,chatbot-4``` which will only allow calls from kognetiks.com and only then to chatbot-4.  Your resources are valuable, take appropriate precautions when allowing remote server access.

### Field Descriptions

1. **Enable Remote Widget**:
   - **Description**: This setting enables and disables remote access on a global basis.  By default, it is set to ```No```.  To allow access by a remote server to a chatbot, you will need to change this setting to ```Yes```.
   - **Input**: Choose ```Yes``` or ```No```.

2. **Allowed Domains**:
    - **Description**: Enter the domain and assistant identified to allow remote access to a chatbot.  For example if the domain is ```kognetiks.com``` and you the chatbot is ```chatbot-4```, then enter ```kognetiks.com,chatbot-4```.  The pairs will be checked at when the remote server calls the chatbot widget endpoint.  If the pair is domain and chatbot are not paired correctly, no chatbot will be present.
    - **Input**: ```domain.com,chatbot-n```
    - **Tip**: Be sure to put each pair on its own line, seperated the domain name and the chatbot shortcode identifier with a coma.
    - **Caution**: Your server and OpenAI resources are valuable.  Be sure to secure those resources by carefully maintaining the allowed pairs of domains and chatbots that you have white listed in this section.

3. **Widget Logging**:
    - **Description**: Widget logging records valid and invalid access to your chatbot(s) from remote servers.  This is especially helpful to ensure that your resources are used only by those that you have allowed.  On the ```Tools``` tab you will find a section titled **Manage Widget Access Logs** where you can download and delete remote widget access.
